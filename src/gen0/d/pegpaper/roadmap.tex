\section{Roadmap}

\subsection{Fuzzing}

Apart from endless recursion in inputs, and straight quantifiers with
an indefinite upper bound (which should be given reasonable limits by
the fuzzer), the PEG grammar and bytecode structure as such (essentially:
one byte at a time, you always know what's coming, alternative paths are
not attempted), make it eminently usable to create fuzzed inputs to the engine.

A fuzzer would be a great tool to verify whether the intention of the
policy designer is met
(as well as a great test for the strength of the engine).

\subsection{Bytecode Transport File Format}

A bytecode format with a cryptography based authentication string (HMAC)
or digital signature, is currently defined.
