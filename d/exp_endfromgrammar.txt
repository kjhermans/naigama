\section{Calling 'end' from Grammar}

The Naigama assembly has the possibility to call 'end' with a specific
code as a parameter. I see this as a handy feature wrt for example
packet handling; several packet matching rules are concatenated and the
end code determines what needs to happen to the packet (discard, forward,
encrypt, etc) - similar to how iptables handles things.

However, the Naigama grammar doesn't support this.
