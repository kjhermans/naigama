This release marks the beginning of a major restructuring of code;
I want the idea of generations being independent, to be completely
implemented at all possible levels. It should be possible to run all
generations with completely different instruction sets, yet use
a previous generation parser for the parser generation of the current
generation parser.

Tests will become specific to a generation, and tests failing will halt
all building. Documentation will be generation specific as well, probably
resulting in many duplications of text.
