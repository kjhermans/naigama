\subsection{Measure: Alignment and Length of Instructions}

\subsubsection{General Alignment on 32 bit Boundaries}

All bytecode, as emitted by the assembler, has the beginning of its
instructions aligned on 32 bit boundaries. This allows one to detect
a bit fault in the least two significant bits of any offset: they should 
always be zero.

\subsubsection{Instruction Length}

The length of an instruction is:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed. That is to say: there are no variable length instructions.
The length of the instruction is given by the opcode.
\item Encoded in the instruction opcode itself. That is to say: the
second most relevant byte contains the length of the instruction, minus
the length of the opcode (which is always four).
\end{itemize}
