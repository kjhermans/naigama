\subsection{Parsing Expression Grammars}

This is the documentation describing Naigama, which is a collection of
specifications, libraries and tools enabling data parsing. It is based, by
now loosely, on Lua Parsing Expression Grammars, or LPEG [REF], which
implements a Packrat [REF] parsing algorithm.

\subsection{Naigama}

Naigama adds to Lua PEG the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item Discoverability features:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A fully fledges assembler step in between grammar and bytecode.
  \item A capable engine debugger.
  \end{itemize}

\item Extra tools:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A disassembler.
  \item A decompiler.
  \end{itemize}

\item Security features:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bit upset event detection and traps.
  \item Endless loop detection.
  \end{itemize}

\item Interoperability with C (library, header files).
\item Added instructions for counters.
\item Added instructions for parsing binary inputs.
\item A scripting language.
\end{itemize}
