\section{Introduction}

This document describes the measures that were implemented in Naigama
\cite{bib:naigama}, which is a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) processing
open source software suite,
based primarily on the ideas of Roberto Ierusalemschy et al
\cite{bib:peg} and the implementation of it in the Lua
scripting language \cite{bib:lua} \cite{bib:lpeg}.

Naigama is a standalone implementation of PEG, with a focus on security.
However, this paper also discusses
the Lua implementation of PEG. For reference, this paper uses
LPEG version 1.0.2.
