\subsection{Measure: Instruction Opcode Hamming Distance}

Naigama bytecode Instruction opcdes are chosen in such a manner
that it takes at least two bit flips for one instruction to be
possibly confused for another (Hamming Distance is always greater than,
or equal to two).

LPEG \cite{bib:lpeg} by contrast, uses a simple enum for the
opcode values [lpvm.h line 12].

[Table \ref{tab:naig_bytecode}] lists all Naigama parser
instructions with their opcode values.

The introduction of Hamming distance in Naigama bytecode instruction
opcode values addresses [Threat \thethreatbcupset].
