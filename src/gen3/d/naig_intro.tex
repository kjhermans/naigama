\subsection{Parsing Expression Grammars}

This is the documentation describing Naigama, which is a collection of
specifications, libraries and tools enabling data parsing. It is based, by
now loosely, on Lua Parsing Expression Grammars, or LPEG [REF], which
implements a Packrat [REF] parsing algorithm.

\subsection{Naigama}

Naigama adds to Lua PEG the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item Discoverability features:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A fully fledges assembler step in between grammar and bytecode.
  \item A capable engine debugger.
  \end{itemize}

\item Extra tools:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A disassembler.
  \item A decompiler.
  \end{itemize}

\item Security features:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bit upset event detection and traps.
  \item Endless loop detection.
  \end{itemize}

\item Interoperability with C (library, header files).
\item As well as Java, Perl and Rust.
\item Added instructions for matchers (ranges, quads).
\item Added instructions for counters (to enable efficient looping).
\item Added instructions for parsing binary inputs.
\end{itemize}
